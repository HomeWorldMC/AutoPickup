# AutoPickup
 A Rising World server plugin that allows players to auto pickup items on the ground.

The plugin folder structure should look like;

This plugin is provided as is. I cannot guarantee its compatibility with other plugins nor its stability. I've tested it pretty thoroughly and it works for me, but I tend to be a pretty hacky coder and there will likely be bugs present. 
<br>That said, I endevour to make sure the plugin will do what is on the tin. If you find an error, contact me (Textra) at the Rising World <a href='https://forum.rising-world.net/'>forums</a> and let me know.
